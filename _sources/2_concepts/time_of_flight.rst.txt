Time-of-Flight (ToF)
=====================

The Time-of-Flight (ToF) module is designed to calculate the time delay between when a particle is detected by a pixel in the detector and a reference time signal provided by one of the Time-to-Digital Converters (TDCs). 

Key Features
------------

- **Automatic Time Calculations**: Automatically computes the time-of-flight for each detected pixel hit relative to a selected reference signal.
- **Multiple Reference Options**: Offers support for different Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) references, allowing flexibility in experimental setups.
- **Easy Configuration**: The ToF feature can be activated with a single configuration setting, simplifying the setup process.

Algorithm Overview
------------------

The ToF module calculates the time delay for detected events through the following steps:

1. **Reference Selection**: The user selects a TDC reference via the Command Line Interface (CLI) or the YAML configuration file. This reference provides the baseline time from which all ToF calculations will be derived.

2. **Timestamp Sorting**: Luna reads the timestamp for each detected signal event (pixel hit) and reference event (TDC). These events are sorted into a single queue based on their timestamps to ensure correct chronological order.

3. **ToF Calculation**: The ToF for each pixel hit is calculated using the selected reference time. The algorithm processes the queue as follows:

   - **Pixel Hit Event**: If the event is a pixel hit, the ToF is computed using the current reference time. The ToF is given by:

     .. math::
        \text{ToF} = \text{ToA}_{\text{Pixel}} - \text{TDC}_{\text{Reference}}

     where:
     
     - :math:`\text{ToA}_{\text{Pixel}}` is the Time of Arrival (ToA) of the pixel hit.
     - :math:`\text{TDC}_{\text{Reference}}` is the timestamp from the current TDC reference event.

   - **TDC Event**: If the event is a TDC event, the current reference time is updated. All subsequent pixel hits will use this new reference time for their ToF calculation.

Performance
-----------

The ToF module is designed to operate efficiently with minimal impact on overall system performance. 
It processes timing data **without** applying timewalk corrections.
