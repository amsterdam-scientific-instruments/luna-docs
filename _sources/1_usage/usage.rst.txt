Luna provides a flexible platform that can be interfaced through both a command-line interface (CLI) and a
YAML configuration system.

:ref:`yaml-interface` : Luna's YAML interface allows for defining detailed configurations in a clear,
human-readable format. This interface is beneficial for setting up complex processes with multiple parameters,
providing an easy way to manage, share, and version configurations. The YAML system simplifies the setup
of extensive workflows and enhances readability and maintainability.

:ref:`cli`: Luna's CLI is for users who prefer direct command execution,
suitable for quickly generating some results. Users can execute Luna commands in the terminal,
specifying configurations through command-line arguments.
