Hdf5 Compression Investigation
==============================

One of the benefits of the yaml interface is the possibility for generating the yaml automatically. This
was particularly useful when evaluating the compression algorithms that come with HDf5 and HDF5-rust. In this
example we generate an exhaustive combination of compression options and visualize how they affect the
processing time and the hdf5 compression.

Given that there are so many combinations, it was practical to use a very small file for this investigation. The
input tpx3 file was 1.1Mb. Below you can see the impact of each of the variables on the file size and processing
performance.

.. note::

    The below data is representative of a very small raw data size (1.1Mb) due to the practicalities of so many luna
    runs. You may base your decision on which algorithm and parameters to use on this data, but keep in mind that
    at this time we do not know if the performance scales as we expect.

    In short, it might be a good idea to use this script and find out for yourself which compression sets are right for
    your data.
