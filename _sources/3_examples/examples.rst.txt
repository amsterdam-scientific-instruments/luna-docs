Examples
========

This section provides practical, hands-on examples using Python to read back data processed by Luna and apply the next analysis steps, such as basic data inspection, making plots or reviewing the timewalk correction.
Each example starts with the Luna command used to process the raw .tpx3 file into an .hdf5 file. 
Then, a Python script is used to read back the data.


.. rubric:: Example Dataset

To start working with these examples, a raw .txp3 data file is required. 
An example dataset can be downloaded here: :download:`example_dataset.tpx3 <../_static/example_data.tpx3>`.
