Time-walk Correction: Apply
===========================

Luna outputs timewalk correction matrix and lookup tables for correcting the ToA
based on the magnitude of the ToT and a relationship inferred from your data. That
relationship can be examined to refine your curve by adjusting the ctot-cut parameter.

However once you are happy with your lookup table application of the correction is a
simple matter of lookup and subtraction.

.. note::

    Since we are (necessarily) using a small tpx3 file for the examples there is some
    instability between the ToT=2000ns - 4000ns. This is because the time walk lookup
    table is inferred directly from your data and since this dataset is minimal there
    may not be enough data to fully inform the timewalk matrix.
